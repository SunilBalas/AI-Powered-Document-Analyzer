Mean:  \\nIt is most popular to measures the central t endency. It is used with both discrete and \\ncontinuous data. The mean is equal to the sum of all the values in the data set divided by the \\nnumber of values in the data set. Therefore, if we have n values in a data set and they have values \\nx1, x2, ..., x n, the sample mean, usually denoted by   is given by,   \\n \\n \\nIf we intend to calculate the population means instead of sample mean then we use the \\ngreet letter µ as  \\n \\nii. Median:  \\nIt is the mid score of a dataset that has been arranged in order of magnitude. In order to \\ncalculate the median, suppose we have the following dataset:  \\n \\n10 20 30 15 20 30 15 20 30 15 20 \\nFirst of all, we re -arrange this data into order of magnitude from smaller to larger  \\n10 15 15 15 20 20 20 20 30 30 30 \\n \\nTherefore, in this case bold figure 20 is our median. It is the middle mark , as there are 5 \\nscores before it and 5 scores after it. However, if we have an odd number of scores like this one,  \\n \\n10 20 30 15 20 15 20 30 15 20 \\n \\nThen , we re-arrange this data into order of magnitude  and we obtain  \\n10 15 15 15 20 20 20 20 30 30 \\n                    \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 5 \\n \\nIn this case, we have to take two values i.e. 20, 20 and average them to get a median i.e. 20 . \\niii. Mode:  \\nIt is a value that most often score in our dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode or \\nmultiple modes.  It can be calculated by finding the value with the maximum frequency. For \\ninstance,  \\n \\n \\nMode  \\n \\n     Two modes  \\n \\nMeasure of Asymmetry:  0123456\\n0123456                    \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 6 \\n \\nSkewness:  \\n It is the measure of asymmetry that shows whether the observations in a dataset are \\nfocused on one side. Skewness can be calculated by the following formula  \\n1\\n𝑛∑ (𝑥𝑖− 𝑥̅)3 𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n√1\\n𝑛−1∑ (𝑥𝑖− 𝑥̅)2 𝑛\\n𝑖=13 \\n There are two types of skewness,  \\ni. Right or Positive Skewness  \\nii. Left or Negative Skewness  \\n \\ni. Right or Positive Skewness:  \\n Right or positive skewness means that the outliers are to the right (long ta il to the right) as \\nshown in figure  \\n \\n \\nMean > median  \\n \\nii. Left or Negative Skewness:  \\n Left or negative skewness means that the outliers are to the left (long tail to the left) as \\nshown in figure  \\n \\nMean < median  010203040\\nSugar Soap Milk Shampoo RiceFrequency\\n010203040\\nSugar Soap Milk Shampoo RiceFrequency                    \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 7 \\n \\nHowever, if mean = median = mode then no skew and therefore, distribution will be \\nsymmetrical.  \\n \\nVariance and Standard Deviation:  \\n Variance and Standard Deviation measure the dispersion of a set of data points around its \\nmeans value.  \\nSample Variance formul a: \\n𝑠2=∑ (𝑥𝑖− 𝑥̅)2 𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛−1 \\n \\nPopulation Variance formula:  \\n𝜎2=∑ (𝑥𝑖− µ)2 𝑁\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑁 \\nSample Standard Deviation formula:  \\n𝑆=√∑ (𝑥𝑖− 𝑥̅)2 𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛−1 \\nPopulation Standard Deviation formula:  \\n𝜎=√∑ (𝑥𝑖− µ)2 𝑁\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑁 \\nCoefficient of Variation:  \\n There is no unit of measurement for Coefficient of variation. Coefficient of variation is \\nperfect for comparison and universal across datasets. Formula of coefficient of variation is given \\nbelow: - \\n𝐶𝑉= 𝑆\\n𝑥̅ \\nCovariance and correlation:  \\nCovariance  Correlation  \\nCovariance is a  statistical measure which is \\ndefined as a systematic relationship between a \\npair of random variables wherein change in one \\nvariable responded by an equivalent change in \\nanother variable  Correlation is a statistical measure which is \\ndefined as a systematic  relationship between a \\npair of random variables wherein movement in \\none variable responded by an equivalent \\nmovement in another variable  \\nThe value of covariance lies between -∞ and \\n+∞ \\n The value of correlation lies between -1 and +1  \\nA covariance of 0 means that the two variables A correlation of 0 means that the two variables                     \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 8 \\n \\nare independent.  are independent  \\nA positive covariance means that two variables \\nmove together  A correlation of 1 means perfect positive \\ncorrelation  \\nA negative  covariance means that the two \\nvariables move in opposite directions  \\n  A correlation of -1 means perfect negative \\ncorrelation.  \\n \\nSample Covariance formula:  \\n \\n𝑆𝑥𝑦=∑ (𝑥𝑖− 𝑥̅)∗(𝑦𝑖− 𝑦̅)𝑛\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑛−1 \\nPopulation Covariance formula:  \\n𝜎𝑥𝑦=∑ (𝑥𝑖− 𝜇𝑥)∗(𝑦𝑖− 𝜇𝑦)𝑁\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑁  \\nSample Correlation formula:  \\n \\n𝑟=𝑠𝑥𝑦\\n𝑠𝑥𝑠𝑦 \\nPopulation Correlation formula:  \\n𝜌=𝜎𝑥𝑦\\n𝜎𝑥𝜎𝑦 \\n \\n \\nB. INFERENTIAL STATISTICS:  \\n \\nProbability  distribution:  \\n It is a statistical function that explains all the possible values and likelihoods that a random \\nvariable can take within a given range. This range will be bounded between the least and the \\nhighest  possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the \\nprobability distribution depends on a number of factors  like distribution's mean , standard \\ndeviation,  skewness, and  kurtosis . Few examples of distributions are,  \\n• Normal distribution  \\n• Binominal distribution  \\n• Student’s T distribution  \\n• Uniform distribution  \\n• Poission distribution  \\n \\nMostly, there is a confusion that distribution is a graph but in fact, it is the  rule that help us \\nin determining how the values are positioned in r elation to each other.  \\n \\ni. Normal Distribution:  \\nIt is also known as Gaussian distribution  or Bell Curve. It is mos tly used in regression \\nanalysis. A lot of  things closely follow this d istribution:  \\n• heights of people                      \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 9 \\n \\n• size of things produced by machines  \\n• errors in measurements  \\n• blood pressure  \\n• marks on a test  \\n• stock market information  \\n \\n \\nWhen data is normal distributed then distribution is symmetric and  \\nMean = median = mode  \\n𝑁 ~(𝜇,𝜎2) \\n \\nWhere, N for normal, ~ for distribution, µ is mean, and 𝜎2 is the variance  \\n \\nii. Standard Normal Distribution:  \\nIt is a  normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 . Every normal \\ndistribution can be standardized using the following formula  \\n𝑎=𝑥− µ\\n𝜎 \\n \\n𝑁 ~(0,1) \\n \\n Standardization permit to compare different normally distributed datasets, test hypothesis, \\ndetect outliers and normality, create confidence intervals and perform regression analysis.  \\n \\niii. Central Limit Theorem:  \\nThis theorem states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal \\ndistribution as the sample size gets larger (assuming that all samples are the same  in size), \\nregardless of population distribution shape.  If the sample sizes = or >30 are consi dered enough for \\nthe Central Limit Theorem to hold.  The main aspect of this theorem is that the average of the \\nsample means and standard deviations will equal the population mean and standard deviation.  \\nFurthermore, an  adequately  large sample size can forecast  the characteristics of a population \\naccurately.  In Central Limit Theorem,  \\n \\n• No matter the distribution  \\n• The more samples , closer to Normal  (k ->∞) \\n• The bigger the samples, the closer to Normal  (n -> ∞) \\n                     \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 10 \\n \\nEstimators and Estimates : \\nEstimators:  \\n It is a mathematical function of the sample that tell us that how to calculate an estimate of \\na parameter from a sample . Smaller the variance, most efficient the estimator. Hence, we required \\nto find what are the “good” estimators. Few vital criteria for goodness of an estimator are based \\non these properties: - \\n- Bias \\n- Variance  \\n- Mean Square Error  \\nExamples of estimators and equivalent parameters are given in below table.  \\nTerm  Estimator  Parameter  \\nMean  𝑥̅ 𝜇 \\nVariance  s2 𝜎2 \\nCorrelation  R 𝜌 \\n \\nEstimates:  \\n An estimate is the output value that you can get from an estimator . There are following \\ntypes of estimates:  \\ni. Point Estimates  – a single value, e.g. 1, 6, 12.34, 0.123  \\nii. Confidence Interval Estimates  – an interval, e.g. (1,4), (43, 45), (3.22, 5.33), ( -0.24, \\n0.26) . We mostly used confidence interval estimates when making inferences because \\nit is more precise as compare to point es timates.  \\nConfidence Interval : \\n It is an interval within which we are assured  with certain %age of confidence, the \\npopulation parameter will fall.  \\nMargin of Error:                      \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 11 \\n \\nA margin of error explain s how many percentage points your results will differ from the \\nreal population value.  It can be calculated by the following two ways:  \\ni. Margin of error = Critical value x Standard deviation  \\nii. Margin of error = Critical value x Standard error  of the statistic  \\nStudent’s T Distribution:  \\n It is mostly used  to estimate population parameters when the sample size  is small  and/or \\npopulation variance are not known. It is pertinent to mention here that it is very useful in such \\ncases where we have not enough information or too much cost is involve  to acquire the requisite \\ninformation.  It has fatter tails as compare to normal distribution and lower peak. Following \\nformula can be used to get the student’s T distribution for a variable with a normally distributed \\npopulation:  \\n𝑡𝑣,𝛼=𝑥̅−𝜇\\n𝑠/√𝑛 where v are the degree of freedom  \\nC. HYPOTHESIS TESTING:  \\nScientific Method:  \\nThe scientific method is a process for gathering data and processing information. It was \\nfirst sketched by Sir Francis Bacon (1561 -1626) to provide logical, rational problem solving \\nacross many scientific fields. The main princi ple of scientific method is systematic observation, \\npredictability, verifiability and amendment of hypothesis. The basic steps of the scientific method \\nare: \\n❖ Make an observation that explains the issue  \\n❖ Make an hypothesis or potential solution to the proble m  \\n❖ Test the hypothesis  \\n❖ If the hypothesis is true then find further evidence or against -evidence  \\n❖ If the hypothesis is false then create a new one or try again  \\n❖ Draw conclusions and purify the hypothesis  \\nWhat is hypothesis?  \\nA hypothesis is an assumption b ased on inadequate evidence that requires further testing \\nand experimentation. After further testing, a hypothesis can generally be confirmed true or false.  \\n                     \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 12 \\n \\nNull Hypothesis (H 0): \\n A null hypothesis is a hypothesis which is required to be tested. It is the hypothesis that \\nthe investigator is trying to show to be false. It is a status -quo. The concept of null is similar to \\nsomeone remain innocent until enough evidence to prove guilty. For instance, someone say, data \\nengineer normal salary is Rs.1,25,000/ - but in our opinion he may be wrong, so, we make \\nstatistical testing to reject this hypo thesis, it is called null hypothesis.  \\n \\nAlternative Hypothesis (H 1 or H A): \\n An alternative hypothesis is inverses of the null hypothesis which is usually based on our \\nown opinion. For instance, someone say, data engineer normal salary is Rs.1,25,000/ - but in our \\nopinion, data engineer cannot earn this value  (less salary ), it is called alternative hypothesis.  \\n \\nDECISIONS:  \\n After testing, there will be two possibility  of decisions i.e. accept the null hypothesis or \\nreject the null hypothesis.  Accept the null hypothesis means there is insufficient  data to support \\nthe alteration  or novelty  brought by the unconventional . Reject the null hypothesis  means there is \\nsufficie nt statistical evidence that show this null hypothesis is false.  \\n \\nLevel of Significance : \\nIt is the probability  of rejecting a null hypothesis by the test when it is really true. It is \\ndenoted by α (Alpha).  \\n \\nConfidence  Level : \\nIt is a  possibility of a parameter that lies within a specified range of values . It is denoted \\nas C. Level of significance  is connected with the confidence level and the relationship between \\nthem is denoted by  c = 1 – α.  The common level of significance and the corresponding \\nconfidence level are given below: -  \\n \\n❖ The level of significance 0.10 is related to the 90% confidence level.  \\n❖ The level of significance 0.05 is related to the 95% confidence level.  \\n❖ The level of significance 0.01 is related to the 99% confidence level.  \\n \\nThe rejection rule is given below: - \\n✓ If p-value ≤ level of significance, then reject the null hypothesis.  \\n✓ If p-value >  level of significance, then do not reject the null hypothesis.                      \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 13 \\n \\n \\nRejection  region:  \\nThe rejection region is the values of test statistic for which the null hypothesis is rejected.  \\n \\nNon rejection  region:  \\nThe set of all possible values for which the null hypothesis is not rejected is called the rejection \\nregion.  \\n \\nOne sided (one -tailed) test is used when the null does not contain equality or inequality \\nsign (<, >, ≤, ≥). The rejection regio n for one -sided (one -tailed) test is shown in figure:  \\n \\n• In the left -tailed test, the rejection region is shaded in left side (as shown in above figure).  \\n \\n• In the right -tailed test, the rejection region is shaded in right side.  \\n \\nTwo sided  (two-tailed) test is used when the null contains equality (=) or inequality (≠) \\nsign.  The rejection region for two-sided ( two-tailed ) test is shown in figure: - \\n \\n \\n \\nStatistical Errors:  \\nThere are two types of statistical errors:  \\n \\ni. Type I Error (False Positive)  \\n                    \\n     © Database Town. com  \\n \\n \\nhttps://d atabasetown. com    Page 14 \\n \\nii. Type II Error (False Negative)  \\n \\nType -I Error  (False Positive) : \\n Type -I error occurs when we  reject  a null hypothesis that is actually  true. The probability \\nof committing type -I error is denoted by α (alpha ). \\n \\nType -I Error (False Negative):  \\nType -II error occurs when we  accept  a null hypothesis that is actually  false.  The \\nprobability of committing type -II error is denoted by β (Beta).  \\n \\n \\nP-value:  \\n The p -value is the smallest level of marginal significance at which the  null \\nhypothesis  would be rejected. A smaller p -value means that there is stronger evidence in support  \\nof the alternative hypothesis.  Usually, p-value is found with 3 digits after the dot  (x.xxx) . \\n \\nThe p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as: \\n• A small  p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) represents  strong evidence against the null hypothesis, \\nso, we reject the null hypothesis.  \\n• A large  p-value (> 0.05) represents  weak evid ence against the null hypothesis, so , we fail \\nto reject the null hypothesis.  0.05 is often the “cut-off-line” .  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\""
